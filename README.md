# MaLPi
Machine learning code for a Raspberry Pi based robot

Blog: http://bleyddyn.github.io/malpi/

## Project Goals

1. To have MaLPi able to wander around without bumping into things (much).
2. To have MaLPi able to return to it's charging station before the battery(ies) run down.
3. Eventually, have MaLPi actively search out new places/views, i.e. explore.
