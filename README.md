# MaLPi
**Ma**chine **L**earning on a Raspberry **Pi** (also a *subtle* reference to the Stargate shows)

A robotics project for playing around with hardware and learning to use Machine Learning techniques.

Blog: http://bleyddyn.github.io/malpi/

## Project Goals

1. To have MaLPi able to wander around without bumping into things (much).
2. To have MaLPi able to return to it's charging station before the battery(ies) run down.
3. Eventually, have MaLPi actively search out new places/views, i.e. explore.
